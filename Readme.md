#Grate Engine
Grate engine is a game engine made for the "I" programming [language](http://github.com/Qlova/ilang).

Currently, only the python target is supported.

Development status:  
**CONCEPTUAL STAGE**

The only features the game currently has are:

* Drawing Circles
* Left,Right,Up,Down input.

Please wait until development matures!

##Biting the bullet:
If you still want to try this out, you will need Python3, Pygame, The I programming language and UCT.
